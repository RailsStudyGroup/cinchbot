rocketbot
========

A bot for our Slack team chat based off of [Slackey](https://github.com/mcmahoniel/slackey).

rocketbot will watch for new users to join and automatically greet them. Additionally, pointing Slack to POST to `http://yourapp.com/slack_command` will allow you to call `/command` and get back general information.

`slack_api_token` must be generated and set before the app will launch.
